## [v2.1.1](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-flutter/tree/v2.1.1) (2023-03-23)

### Enhancements

- bump iOS version to 4.1.0 [\#102](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-flutter/pull/102)

#

## [v2.1.0](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-flutter/tree/v2.1.0) (2023-03-06)

### NOTE:
- From this version we will prefix randomly generated device-specific distinct_ids with "$device:". The prefix is applied the next time a new random ID is generated, any IDs generated by previous SDK versions and  persisted on the device will continue to be used as-is until reset is called to generate a new ID. This does not change the value sent for the $device_id property, which will continue to be the randomly-generated ID without a prefix. Mixpanel's $identify endpoint has been updated to accept UUIDs with this prefix to coordinate with this change.

### Enhancements

- bump ios to 4.0.5 and android to 7.3.0 [\#99](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-flutter/pull/99)

#

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-flutter/tree/v2.0.0) (2022-09-09)

### BREAKING CHANGE: 
This major release removes all remaining calls to Mixpanel's `/decide` API endpoint. The main effect of this is that the SDK no longer fetches the remote status of your [project's "Automatically collect common mobile events" setting](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004596186#enable-or-disable-common-mobile-events). From this version forward, automatic event tracking can only be controlled by the, now required, parameter `trackAutomaticEvents`. Upon upgrading, existing implementations will need to add this parameter to their Mixpanel initializer calls. 

```
import 'package:mixpanel_flutter/mixpanel_flutter.dart';

class MixpanelManager {
  static Mixpanel? _instance;

  static Future<Mixpanel> init() async {
    if (_instance == null) {
      _instance = await Mixpanel.init("YOUR_PROJECT_TOKEN", trackAutomaticEvents: true);
    }
    return _instance!;
  }
}

```
